## What is Social Money?

Social Money is non official currency used by a specific group of people (a kind of club) as a mean of exchange for products and services.  It’s seen as an instrument for support local development (a district, for example), making the local economy more robust. The Social Money is designed in such a way that keeps the money circulating locally, retaining the wealth in the neighborhood.

Usually the Social Money is issued and managed from communitarian banks, also called social banks.

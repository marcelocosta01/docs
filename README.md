## About SocialBanks.Co
**SocialBanks.co** is a SaaS platform that uses  [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) Technology in order to facilitate the issuance and management of local social money and make the social banks creation cheaper, easier and safer. At the same time, Bitcoin Technology can be used to receive donations worldwide directed to boost the local community economy. 

For now the SocialBanks is directed to Brazilian Social Banks backed in Real (R$), but the platform can be easily integrated with other currencies and countries in the future.

## History
SocialBanks was born as a project of a team of Brazilian software developers competing in the 2015 Coinbase Bitcoin Hackaton ([BitHack V2](https://developers.coinbase.com/bithack)).

## What is Social Money?

Social Money is non official currency used by a specific group of people (a kind of club) as a mean of exchange for products and services.  It’s seen as an instrument for support local development (a district, for example), making the local economy more robust. The Social Money is designed in such a way that keeps the money circulating locally, retaining the wealth in the neighborhood.

Usually the Social Money is issued and managed from communitarian banks, also called social banks.

The number of social banks in Brazil with his own currency doubled in five years, as reported by the “Rede Brasileira de Bancos Comunitários” (Brazilian Network of Communitarian Banks). In 2009 there were 51 institutions, and in 2014 there where 104.

In 2014 those communitarian banks were responsible for grant R$ 18 millions (about U$ 6 millions) in micro-credit and R$600k (about U$ 200k) as a “local social money”.

Communitarian banks also contribute to overcome the lack of banking services in underdeveloped neighborhoods and cities. They are also important because of their social roles: neighborhood associations control them, and the community itself will decide the investments direction and loans approval as well.

The social money should follow some guidelines:
* Be backed in the official Fiat currency (for example, Brazilian Reais – R$);
* Be indexed by the official currency (usually 1 x 1);
* Allow exchange with official currency with some mechanism of incentive to keep the social money circulating;
* Be used locally based on the coverage of the social bank.
